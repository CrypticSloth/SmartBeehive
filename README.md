# SmartBeehive
Project to make my beehive smarter through data collection and observation.

## Install

Package uses Ultralytics, which requires manual install of torch. Install here: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/.

On Windows for CUDA, also ensure all C++ redistributables are installed by installing the Visual Studio Community edition with the Desktop C++ worktable. Then Torch with CUDA will work.
